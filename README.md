# RippleMatch

## Inspiration

Have you ever experienced the frustration of losing touch with someone special, like a friend from a memorable summer camp or a connection made at a networking event? I certainly have. This realization led me to embark on the journey of creating RippleMatch.

I was reflecting on an old photo from a Grade 5 Summer Camp, recalling the joy of spending time with a friend whose name and contact information I had long forgotten. It felt like I had lost a precious connection forever. This personal experience inspired me to develop RippleMatch, a solution that combines the power of facial recognition with messaging and XRP transactions.
